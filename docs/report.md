## Speculation

> Describe your approach to wiring the circuit you derived. How did you use gates and/or transistors?

`TODO`

> The assignment contained a small note about wiring. What did you observe about challenges with wiring?
> What kinds of tips would you give someone approaching this problem for the first time?

`TODO`

> In what ways does this _expand_ our understanding of the lessons we learned from basic transistor
> logic in the previous week?
